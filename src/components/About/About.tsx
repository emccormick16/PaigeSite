        I have been a speech pathologist for 10 years, specializing in the
        assessment and treatment of speech, language, voice, and swallowing
        disorders. My experience includes working with a diverse population of
        patients, ranging from young children with developmental delays to
        elderly adults with neurodegenerative conditions. I have also worked in
        a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, schools, and
        private practice. Throughout my career, I have been passionate about
        providing compassionate and evidence-based care to help my patients
        achieve their communication and swallowing goals. I have pursued ongoing
        professional development to stay current with the latest research and
        techniques in the field, and have collaborated with other healthcare
        professionals to provide comprehensive care to my patients.{" "}
